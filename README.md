# Dynamic Navigation and Interaction Project

## Project Overview

This project enhances the user experience on web page by dynamically generating a navigation bar based on the content sections available on the page. It features an interactive navigation experience, including highlighting active sections as users scroll through the page, supporting smooth scrolling to sections upon navigation link clicks, and hiding the navigation bar when the user is not scrolling.

### Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Bar**: Automatically populates based on the sections of the page, making it scalable and easy to maintain for pages with varying amounts of content.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: As the user scrolls through the page, the section currently in the viewport is highlighted in the navigation bar, providing clear visual feedback on the user's current position.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking a navigation link scrolls the page smoothly to the corresponding section, enhancing the user experience over abrupt jumps.
- **Auto-Hiding Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar hides when the user is not scrolling, allowing for a more immersive and unobstructed view of the page content.
